# hello
This is my first github project.
I am trying to experiment the way GitHub works. For example, I am not having a little bit difficulty getting the `new branch` works.

OK, it must have been a while now (it is now May 10, 2018), and I am still figuring out how this github version control/sharing web based service can help me directing student to write share project groupware... Hopefully, the next time I edit it; I might have some clue.
